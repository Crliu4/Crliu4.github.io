 <br><br>
**Project description:** Civid Digital Fellow (summer 2022) at the U.S. Census Bureau's Economic Indicators Division. The goal of the project was to enhance the usefulness of Business Formation Statistics (BFS), one of the Census Bureauâ€™s newest data products that provides insight into early-stage business development. I conducted exploratory linking and analysis in python (pandas) between BFS and demographic data from other Census surveys.

 <br><br>
**Project description:** Final group project for Machine Learning for Public Policy (CAPP30254). The goal of this project is to predict healthcare sector stock prices. The target variables are stock price and the relative daily change of a stock. The features used come from financial data and COVID-related tweets. The entire project is divided into three phases, where each phase tries to solve problems that arose in the previous phase.

**Project description:** Final group project for Computer Science with Applications II (CAPP30122). Stock prices are influenced by the public attitude towards the market. Twitter is a popular place for users to express their moods and sentiments towards a
variety of topics. We looked into how the polarity of sentiments in tweets is related to the daily movements of stock prices!
