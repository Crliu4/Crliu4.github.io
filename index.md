[Data Science Clinic: Electronic Monitoring Device Shielding Detection](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aoW09WtfLm_2ymvJRobTAXZmZ3c5kQtR/view?usp=share_link)
 <!-- <br><br> -->
**Project description:** Electronic Monitoring (EM) can be an effective, safe, and humane means of decarceration if management software can appropriately identify serious infractions. EM participants can have free movement to go to work, school, and
reintegrate into their communities. Device shielding or the deliberate obstruction of devices with foil to
prevent their location from being tracked may be a significant source of risk. Some participants are able to successfully do so and have been allegedly involved in criminal behavior while their signal was lost. Many other participants simply lose their signal due to
environmental factors such as living in a built-up environment, basement, or the like. At the moment, Cook County has no way to examine signal characteristics and check in with those that are most suspicious. The team designed & conducted field tests to build sufficient ground-truth on device GPS signal loss and built logistic and XGBoost models in Python/Jupyter Notebook to identify whether device shielding was occurring. Code and video presentation available upon request.

[Coding it Forward Civic Digital Fellowship](https://github.com/codingitforward/cdf2022/blob/main/Carolyn_Liu.pdf)
 <!-- <br><br> -->
**Project description:** Civid Digital Fellow (summer 2022) at the U.S. Census Bureau's Economic Indicators Division. The goal of the project was to enhance the usefulness of Business Formation Statistics (BFS), one of the Census Bureauâ€™s newest data products that provides insight into early-stage business development. I conducted exploratory record linkage and analysis in Python between the Business Formation Statistics data product and various demographic datasets (Annual Business Survey & Nonemployer Statistics by Demographics) to develop a process (matching by unique identifier; resolving duplicates to select primary record) for an improved data product. Presented findings to external audiences and senior internal leadership on the process for assembling a more equitable & improved data product to help businesses, policymakers, regional planners, and researchers assess the current state of early entrepreneurship at the national and state levels.

[Analyzing COVID Twitter Sentiments on Healthcare Stock Price Movements](https://github.com/Crliu4/capp30254_fight_potatoes.git)
 <!-- <br><br> -->
**Project description:** Final group project for Machine Learning for Public Policy (CAPP30254). The goal of this project is to predict healthcare sector stock prices. The target variables are stock price and the relative daily change of a stock. The features used come from financial data and COVID-related tweets. The entire project is divided into three phases, where each phase tries to solve problems that arose in the previous phase. We conducted sentiment analysis on COVID-related Tweets to extract tweet polarity, preprocessed data & performed feature selection using information gain criteria. We developed logistic regression, random forest, gradient descent & support vector classification models to predict stock price direction based on time series data for multiple train-test datasets (9-month training; the following 6-months for testing).

### Python Application
[Stock Market Prediction using Twitter Sentiments](https://github.com/uchicago-CAPP30122-win-2022/proj-fight_potatoes)
 <!-- <br><br> -->
**Project description:** Final group project for Computer Science with Applications II (CAPP30122). Stock prices are influenced by the public attitude towards the market. Twitter is a popular place for users to express their moods and sentiments towards a
variety of topics. We used Python (pandas) to build basic models on how tweet polarity & sentiments are related to the daily movements of stock prices. Then coded with Python (Plotly Dash) to deploy an interactive dashboard for users to visualize the findings.

### Data Visualization
[Final Project - The Tate Collection through the Years](https://crliu4.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/final_project/code/project.html)
 <!-- <br><br> -->
**Project description:** Final Project for Data Visualization for Policy Analysis (CAPP30239). Coded primarily in D3.js to conduct visual storytelling (used stacked bar, interactive treemap & modified beeswarm charts) about the Tate Gallery Collection throughout time.
