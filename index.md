### Data Science
[Data Science Clinic: Electronic Monitoring Device Shielding Detection](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aoW09WtfLm_2ymvJRobTAXZmZ3c5kQtR/view?usp=share_link)
 <!-- <br><br> -->
**Project description:** Electronic Monitoring (EM) can be an effective, safe, and humane means of decarceration if management software can appropriately identify serious infractions. At the moment, Cook County has no way to examine signal characteristics and check in with
those that are most suspicious. The team designed & conducted field tests to build sufficient ground-truth on device GPS signal loss and built logistic and XGBoost models to identify whether device shielding was occurring. Code available upon request.

[Coding it Forward Civic Digital Fellowship](https://github.com/codingitforward/cdf2022/blob/main/Carolyn_Liu.pdf)
 <!-- <br><br> -->
**Project description:** Civid Digital Fellow (summer 2022) at the U.S. Census Bureau's Economic Indicators Division. The goal of the project was to enhance the usefulness of Business Formation Statistics (BFS), one of the Census Bureauâ€™s newest data products that provides insight into early-stage business development. I conducted exploratory linking and analysis in python (pandas) between BFS and demographic data from other Census surveys. 

[Analyzing COVID Twitter Sentiments on Healthcare Stock Price Movements](https://github.com/Crliu4/capp30254_fight_potatoes.git)
 <!-- <br><br> -->
**Project description:** Final group project for Machine Learning for Public Policy (CAPP30254). The goal of this project is to predict healthcare sector stock prices. The target variables are stock price and the relative daily change of a stock. The features used come from financial data and COVID-related tweets. The entire project is divided into three phases, where each phase tries to solve problems that arose in the previous phase.

### Python Application
[Stock Market Prediction using Twitter Sentiments](https://github.com/uchicago-CAPP30122-win-2022/proj-fight_potatoes)
 <br><br>
**Project description:** Final group project for Computer Science with Applications II (CAPP30122). Stock prices are influenced by the public attitude towards the market. Twitter is a popular place for users to express their moods and sentiments towards a
variety of topics. We looked into how the polarity of sentiments in tweets is related to the daily movements of stock prices!

### Data Visualization
[Final Project - The Tate Collection through the Years](https://crliu4.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/final_project/code/project.html)
 <br><br>
**Project description:** Final Project for Data Visualization for Policy Analysis (CAPP30239). Coded primarily in D3.js to conduct visual storytelling (used stacked bar, interactive treemap & modified beeswarm charts) about the Tate Gallery Collection throughout time.
